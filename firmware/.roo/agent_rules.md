# Agentic Coding Rules

## Style

1. When making MarkDown files, please leave a blank line between all headings and body/lists/text/code-fence.
2. More MarkDown rules: Lists should be surrounded by blank lines.
3. Remember to number the Todo lists.

## Tool Preferences

1. For CircuitPython or MicroPython projects, prefer `mpremote` instead of `ampy`.
2. For virtual COM port serial monitoring in macOS, prefer the port name style /dev/cu.usbserial-110 instead of tty.
